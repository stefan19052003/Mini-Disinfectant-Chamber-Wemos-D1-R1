# Arduino-based Mini Disinfectant Chamber
This code will provide a simple arduino mechanism to run a mini disinfectant chamber. In this disinfectant chamber, we will be able to automatically spray disinfectant to medium sized object such as package and food delivery. This chamber should provide contactless receiving between the courier and the recipient thus decreasing the possibility of COVID-19 spread. 

## Tools and Materials
1. Wemos D1 R1 microcontroller
2. 5V Relay
3. 12V Water pump
4. Breadboard
5. Ultrasonic Sensor(HV-SR04)
